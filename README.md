# Gesktop - JavaScript virtual desktop GUI

**Gesktop** is the demonstrational but fully-capable project based on **GlibJS**. It is a single-page application to present content in a manner similiar to the way you know from the operating systems. Although the final outcome might not be so appealing, the way it's build certainly is. It's very customisable so you can introduce custom components with almost effortlessly. It's easy to maintain. It is dependent on jQuery (no UI dependency) only.
